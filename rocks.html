        <h1>rocks</h1>
        <h2>DISTROS</h2>
        <p>FEDORA: a simple, clean distribution that i have never had a single problem using. no wonder daddy torvalds uses it as his daily driver.</p>
        <p>UBUNTU: honestly ubuntu kinda stinks now (fuck snapcraft), but i'll give it the credit of starting my love of linux and foss.</p>
        <p>ARCH: a simple, lightweight distro that adheres to the kiss philosophy, along with a highly modular installer. also, pacman absolutely rocks.</p>
        <p>DEBIAN: an incredibly stable distro which is a go-to choice of mine whenever i install linux. i know everyone hates the shit out of the installer, but i think it's actually ok.</p>
        <h2>DEs/WMs</h2>
        <p>GNOME: this applies to both version 3 and 4x. i have never had a problem with it, and it is always a smooth experience regardless of the situation. easily my go-to desktop env.</p>
        <p>i3wm/swaywm: an easy to use and master window manager. this was what introduced me to the world of window managers, and the simple configuration plus it's modularity is fantastic for all users, be it beginners and hardcore unixporn ricers</p>
        <h2>APPLICATIONS</h2>
        <p>FIREFOX: a beautiful, easy-to-use (and open source) broswer which i would happily use any day. </p>
        <p>LIBREOFFICE: an open source office suite increadibly similar to the popular microsoft office suite. i was surprised by the number of features this housed, and it is a worthy competitor to msoffice in my eyes.</p>
        <p>CODE - OSS: an open source variant of the popular IDE visual studio code, which i am currently using to write this very website, along with all of my other software.</p>
        <h2>FILMS/TV SHOWS</h2>
        <p>ATTACK ON TITAN: this show is amazing. enough said.</p>
        <p>LAID-BACK CAMP: this is a slice-of-life anime covering a group of young campers who travel the japanese countryside. it's a cosy show that is the perfect wrap-up-in-a-blanket on a friday evening companion, along with some steaming chai latte.</p>
        <p>TOKYO GHOUL: another action show like attack on titan, this is a gripping and brilliant show that grabs you by the neck and refuses to let go until you've finished the final episode. tokyo ghoul :re stinks though.</p>
        <p>YOUR NAME: a touching film about two people who swap bodies unintentionally, and try to find each other while trying to navigate their new lives. it's an emotional film that is as beautiful to watch as it is to reflect on.</p>
