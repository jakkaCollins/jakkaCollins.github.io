      <h1>ROCKS</h1>
      <h2>DISTROS</h2>
      <p>FEDORA: A simple, clean distribution that I have never had a single problem using, as it incorporates the latest kernel and package releases with the RPM package system.. It is no surprise that Linus Torvalds uses it as his daily driver!</p>
      <p>UBUNTU: In all honesty Ubuntu is not that great in it's current state, however I'll give it the credit of establishing my love of GNU/Linux and FOSS.</p>
      <p>ARCH: A simple, lightweight distribution that adheres to the KISS philosophy, as well as incorporating bleeding-edge packages for the latest updates, plus a highly modular installer. It is also home to my favourite package manager of all time: pacman.</p>
      <p>DEBIAN: An incredibly stable distro which is a go-to choice of mine whenever I wish to install GNU/Linux. The project is backed by a massive community and thousands of dedicated contributors.</p>
      <h2>DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS/WINDOW MANAGERS</h2>
      <p>GNOME: This applies to both version 3 and 4x. I have very rarely had a problem with GNOME, and it always results in a smooth experience regardless of the situation or task. It is easily my go-to desktop environment.</p>
      <p>i3WM/SwayWM: A simple to use, as well as master, window manager. i3WM was what introduced me to the world of window managers, and the simple configuration, in addition to its modularity is splendid for all users, be it beginners or hardcore r/UnixPorn ricers</p>
      <h2>APPLICATIONS</h2>
      <p>FIREFOX: A beautiful, easy-to-use (and open source) broswer which I would happily use any day of the week. </p>
      <p>LIBREOFFICE: An open source office suite incredibly similar to the popular Microsoft Office Suite. I was surprised by the number of features this Suite housed, and it is a worthy competitor to MSOffice in my eyes.</p>
      <p>CODE - OSS: An open source variant of the popular IDE Visual Studio Code, which I am currently using to write this very website, along with all of my other software.</p>
      <h2>FILMS/TV SHOWS</h2>
      <p>ATTACK ON TITAN: This show is absolutely amazing, and I advise you to watch it for yourself to see why. </p>
      <p>LAID-BACK CAMP: This is a slice-of-life anime covering a group of young campers who travel the Japanese countryside. It is a cosy show that is the perfect wrap-up-in-a-blanket on a Friday evening companion, along with some steaming Chai Latte.</p>
      <p>TOKYO GHOUL: Another action show like Attack on Titan, this is a gripping and brilliant show that grabs you by the neck and refuses to let go until you've finished every last episode.</p>
      <p>YOUR NAME: A touching film about two people who unknowingly and unintentionally body-swap, and attempt to locate one other whilst trying to navigate their new lives. It is an emotional film that is as beautiful to watch as it is to reflect upon.</p>
      <p>FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER: A situation comedy about a British-Jewish household and their bizarre antics on their Friday night meal-time. To say that this show is hilarious would be an grotesque understatement; if you are an avid fan of sitcoms, or are looking to get into them, this is a must watch.</p>
      <p>HARLEY QUINN: Another comedy centering around the titular supervillain, who's looking to make a name for herself in Gotham City after her breakup with the Joker. It's an absolute blast from start to finish, and holds the prestigious role of being my favourite TV series of all time.</p>
      <h2>GAMES</h2>
      <p>CELESTE: A girl climbs a mountain. It's a simple premise that leads into an absolutely spectacular experience backed by impeccable level design, music and character. It is also my faourite game of all time. </p>
      <p>POKEMON BLACK/WHITE: My favourite game in the series, thanks to it's increased focus on story, character and plot, more so than other Pokemon games. It's upsetting to me that most people don't hold this title in higher standards. </p>
      <p>FINAL FANTASY VII: A blast of a game full of story, great characters and gameplay along with one of the most notoriously terrifying villains of all time. An essential for any RPG fan. </p>
