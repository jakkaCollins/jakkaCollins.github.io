        <h1>The internet should not be a place of belonging.</h1>
        <p>The internet has grown a lot in its 50 plus years of existence. Starting out as a tool conceived by the United States Military by the Advanced research Project Agency (ARPA) known as ARPANET to share information and documents between scientists during the space race, the concept of a world-wide network was gradually developed over time, and all the ideas that came with it - packet switching in order to ensure data is sent across the network correctly, protocols such as TCP/IP to ensure a common ground for communication, Tim Berners Lee's World Wide Web introduced in 1989, and the boom of consumer internet in the 90s (with  operating systems like Windows 98 centred on internet functionality). The internet was, and still is, a marvel.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the internet has transformed from simple document sharing to something people's lives revolve around - online video gaming being one of the most popular multimedia industries, web chat sites such as Discord, Twitter and Reddit are amassing millions of users, and video sharing sites like YouTube and Vimeo allowing people to make a living off posting content for the masses. And the more that people use the internet, the more their lives start to revolve around it to a larger and larger extent. This has become a concern for parents of children, who'd rather play the latest online shooter than communicate with their kin or engage with studies. Reddit and Discord servers have become a second home for some, and nowadays people substitute communication in the real world for chatting with anonymous identities on an LCD screen.</p>
        <p>Our modern relationship with the internet is quite strange (and as I will show, very dangerous) - cosmically distant from it's original purpose. It has become a place of belonging for so many people across the world rather than an information transmission system. And I believe that this relationship is dangerous in so many ways to the quality of life of modern peoples. I have two main reason why I dislike the idea of the internet being used as a place of belonging.</p>
        <h2>1) The more people use the internet, the easier they are to manipulate</h2>
        <p>If you have ever read a newspaper of any kind, you will see how prevalent opinions are. If X and Y are polarised opinions on a certain subject matter, most of the time the bias of a person's preference for X over Y is easy to see. While there are many pros and cons to X and Y, no one should seriously trust other people's opinions as a legitimate reason for X over Y, no matter how compelling their arguments or statistics are. The reader may even have the rationale to identify what's wrong with the paper's argument, but this alone isn't the issue. Now take this opinion to somewhere like a social networking sites, where information and statistics are processed by people all over the world with surprising efficiency, and you have yourself an interesting situation - most people take whatever they see, and believe it to be fact. They don't need any verifiable proof that product A is better for facial care than product B, all they need is a simple argument statistic favouring the former, and they believe it. They almost become hooked to what they are being fed, and the only feeling they have is that they must consume more.</p>
        <p>Attention spans of people who regularly browse social media is surprisingly short, as they are hungry for more information. This is similar to a mother bird feeding it's young. The young must eat as it is desperate for food, but unlike in real life the mothers are happy to deliver any food regardless of whether or not it will harm the chick. If it benefits the mother in the form of instant gratification (likes, shares, etc.) it does not care about what it feeds the young. Now it is quite obvious to see what is wrong with most social media sites. Addiction loops are used to pull a consumer in, and once they are pulled in, it is very hard to escape. Misinformation is spread easily, for example the COVID-19 anti-vaccination crisis, where misinformation was spread across the world by people with or without intent to do harm, and the modern world becomes embroiled with lies. The common person is manipulated into a proxy for other people's ideologies.</p>
        <h2>2) "Internet Friends" are as trusted as real friends</h2>
        <p>Let's recap how you would make friends in real life - you meet someone with similar interests and bond over your common hobbies. You chat with them, and find them a likeable person. You become friends, as you reveal more about yourself to this person as they do the same, deepening your relationship. It all relies on the concept of trust - you trust this person will not torment you about your hobbies, and as a result, you won't do that to them either. Trust is vital in relationships, and a strong friendship cannot be sustained without it. This entire time, you are confident that the person you chat to is a legitimate person and not someone putting a mask on to manipulate you. Unfortunately manipulation does happen, but the chances of it happening purely in a physical space is very rare.</p>
        <p>Now parallel this with making a friend on an online forum. You chat and make friends, but rather than this person that you meet being fully legitimate, they are ultimately not a person - they are an identity on an internet domain. As a result, these people you chat with often use the anonymous nature of the internet to hide who they truly are. This is when problems start to occur. You start to devote more time to people online, but you are actually devoting more time to tapping on a mobile phone screen, closing you off from others. Unlike in real life, it is harder to sustain your real world relationships chatting to a screen, and as a result your family/friend life starts to suffer, spending more time with people on the screen. They can convince you to do irrational things. You do this because you have put the same amount of trust in them as you do a physical friend, leading to sometimes dangerous consequences.</p>
        <p>This behaviour is unfortunately common, and it is the root of criminal activities such as grooming and scams. Replacing communication with real world people for communication with a person online who may or may not be real is a critical blunder, and one that people should be educated on.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While I do believe that the internet is a remarkable achievement and a championing example of humanity's potential, the ideology of it being a place of belonging is endangering the modern world. I hope this blog enlightens people to spend more time with family and friends, and to never trust parrots on the internet as a source of information.</p>
