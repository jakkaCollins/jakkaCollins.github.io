        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>my name is finlay collins (but i go via the pseudonym jakkaCollins online), and i am a british computer enthusiast, information activist and musician. i am currently 15 years old and i like to play games, watch anime, write code as well as websites.</p>
        <p>i was born in 2006 with a condition called <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_agammaglobulinemia" target="_blank">x-linked agammaglobulinemia</a> (or xla for short) which basically means i have no immune system to call my own. as a kid, i was also very socially incompetent (to the point where my parents had to get me speech and language therapy) which lead to me withdrawing for social interactions and spending more time on the computer. this sparked a love for computing that still burns strong to this day. i soon became very passionate about computer science and software development, and after discovering gnu/linux in 2019 with the release of ubuntu 19.04, i have been able to learn all about how computers actually work, in addition to learning about programming, system administration, cybersecurity, as well as free and open source software. this has allowed me to become more familiar and understand computers more, and has allowed me to finally affirm my role as the family tech person.</p>
        <p>i adhere to the kiss philosophy, which stands for 'keep it simple, stupid!' (but i prefer shithead because it sounds objectively funnier), and i heavily believe this philosophy should be applied to all aspects of the computer science field, as it avoids superfluous complication and errors. this style is heavily reflected in this website (this is a very simple and boring website) and in the softare that i write. i believe overcomplication causes a bloated and unsatisfactory experience for not just users, but developers as it results in lost time fixing issues that wouldn't be there if a simplistic philosophy was followed, which also ends up affecting the end user in the form of slower and buggier performance in applications and software.</p>
        <p>as for what i do in my spare time, i like to play video games and i also like to repair hardware (i like to repair old and broken games consoles for fun, and also because i love looking at system internals). i hate capital letters, and i also watch way to much youtube in my spare time to the point of it being an addiction, as well as anime (head over to my <a href="/rocks">rocks</a> page to see some of my favourites). i also listen to music, mainly lofi girl's lofi hip-hop playlist, which was the main thing that inspired my to start making music, as well as game composers like nobuo uematsu's final fantasy soundtrack and lena raine's score for celeste, both of which are fantastic listens and plays.</p>
