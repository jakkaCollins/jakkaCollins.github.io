        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>My name is Finlay Collins (but I go via the pseudonym jakkaCollins online), and I am a British computer enthusiast, information activist and musician. I am currently 15 years old and I enjoy playing video games, watching TV shows, writing code and software as well as websites.</p>
        <p>I was born in 2006 with a condition called <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_agammaglobulinemia" target="_blank">X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia</a> (or XLA in shorthand) which means in summary I have no Immune System. As a kid, I was also very socially incompetent, to the point where my parents had to invest in speech and language therapy. This led to me withdrawing for social interactions and spending more time on the computer. This sparked a love for computing that still burns strong to this day. I soon became very passionate about computer science and software development, and after discovering GNU/Linux in 2019 with the release of Ubuntu 19.04, I have been able to learn all about how computers actually work, in addition to learning about programming, system administration, cybersecurity, as well as free and open source software.</p>
        <p>I adhere to the KISS philosophy (shorthand for "Keep It Simple, Stupid!"), and I heavily believe this philosophy should be applied to all aspects of the computer science field, as it avoids superfluous complication and errors. This style is heavily reflected in the relative simplicity of this website, and in the software that I write. I believe overcomplication causes a bloated and unsatisfactory experience for not just users, but developers as it results in lost time fixing issues that wouldn't be there if a simplistic philosophy was followed,affecting the end user in the form of slower and buggier performance in applications and software.</p>
        <p>As for what I do in my spare time, I enjoy playing video games as well as repairing hardware (I take pleasure in repairing old and broken games consoles). I also watch an unhealthy amount of YouTube in my spare time to the point of it being an addiction, as well as Anime and TV (Head over to my <a href="/rocks">Rocks</a> page to see some of my favourites). I also enjoy listening to music such as ChillHop and Video Game music, as well as other alternative genres like rock and metal.</p>
